	Hey you managed to stumble across this abomination!

<p>
	Well since you're here I might as well tell you about myself. First of all, I'm not a creep lets get that out of the way. Second, I made this place so welcome. I play game whenever I can at this point because, most my time gets wasted on school and work. I wish I could say I play games for a living, but I am slowly making that dream come true.
